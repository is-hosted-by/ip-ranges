# Writ

Opinionated, classless styles for semantic HTML.

## Usage

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//writ.cmcenroe.me/1.0.2/writ.min.css">
```

Writ is served through the CloudFlare CDN.

## Goals

- Drop-in stylesheet
  - No classes
  - No extra elements
- Responsive, without special-casing
- Visually pleasing

## Motivation

<abbr>HTML</abbr> is super easy to write. Markdown is even easier to write and
generate <abbr>HTML</abbr> from. But what does it look like?

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="Default styles" width="285" src="screenshot/default.png">
</p>

Not very nice, and it gets worse the more there is. Applying the Writ
stylesheet makes it better.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="Writ styles" width="285" src="screenshot/writ.png">
</p>

## Caveats

Writ is designed for modern, standards compliant browsers only. There are no
compatibility hacks. Writ is tested on the latest stable releases of Safari,
Chrome and Firefox.
